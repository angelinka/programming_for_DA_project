## Description

This repository was created to complete the project for Programming for Data Analysis module at ATU by utilising Jupyter notebooks.

## Explore

There is one main file in this repository:
`audiobooks.ipynb` outlines project objectives, provides interesting facts about audibooks as a research done on the subject and moves to the main part of simulating and analazing the data.

Additional files/folders:
- README.md
- requirements text file - requirements.txt
- a gitignore file - .gitignore
- data folder - where data set is stored as csv file

## How to install the notebook

You need to run this notebook in python environment (please refer to packages and dependencies in requirements.txt file) the easiest way to do that is to install Anaconda
1. Download [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html). If not using Anaconda can install packages via ***pip install / homebrew install*** (Example: pip install matplotlib).
2. Download [cmder](https://cmder.net) if using Windows. Or use Terminal if on macOS or Linux.

## How to run the notebook

1. Open terminal / cmder.
2. Run command `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` from command line. It's a web application which runs on your local machine (you will be able to see the server running in Terminal/cmder). To stop the application running press control+c and then type 'y' to confirm.
3. The browser page should open up automatically. Select the file you would like to view.

You can also start `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` from Anaconda-Navigator.

You can view the notebook in static or dynamic form by clicking the following images:
